ansible is designed as a declarative automation tool, meaning ansible playbooks should describe the desired state of a system.
one of the conflicts i've been grappling with is the initial installation of these systems, thus my ansible playbooks have mostly been install scripts.
going forward, i plan on writing playbooks which will both handle the initial installation of these systems as well as maintain a desired state when run against these systems post-installation.


there are also a couple of other things.
    1. i have a directory /files, which maintains subdirectories for specific playbooks.
        ansible searches $current_working_directory/files, so i will be moving toward a file layout of "system/ > playbook.yaml, files", which will keep things more clean.

    2. if you're doing it the way i have been, and adding hosts: all to your playbooks, you're doing it wrong.
        ansible first necessitates the creation of an inventory, be it a database or file.
        while the content of this database won't be published, the host groups used in playbooks will.
        keep these generic.
